# NEO2D

An agent that learns information and builds associations between objects in its environment. NOW IN AMAZING 2D!

NEO is an attempt to simulate how people learn from experience with objects in the real world and how we can replicate that understanding
within machines. This project is a continuation of our Society's previous project 
[NEO_LEARNING_SOFTBOT](https://github.com/sai-byui/NEO_Learning_Softbot), which placed NEO in a 1d text-based
environment. For this semester project Neo will be moving within a 2D visual environment. The project combines our pathfinding work from 
[Bot-Arena-3](https://github.com/sai-byui/bot-arena-3) and our database architecture from NEO version 1.

This program runs off of python 3.6+ code. You will need to install 3.6 or higher to run the project.
The project also uses the pygame library to create the visuals and pttysx3 to generate Neo's voice. Both libraries will need to be 
installed to run NEO2D.
